# Single Player Canvas

1. Start by creating a folder, and dragging the js and style folders into it

2. Then create a simple html file (be sure to name it index!).
   You can reference `index_finished.html` for any help
  
```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <title>A game built using HTML5 canvas</title>
      <meta charset="utf-8">

      <!-- Just makes the window hide any overflow of canvas -->
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="style/game.css">
    </head>
    <body>

    </body>
  </html>
```

3. We need a canvas, it's what we will draw our player on. 
   Put this code between the `<body>` and `</body>` tags

```html
<canvas id="gameCanvas"></canvas>
```

4. Now let's inject some basic scripts into our html file. Add these tags right before `</body>`

```html
<script src="js/Keys.js"></script>
<script src="js/Player.js"></script>
<script src="js/game.js"></script>
```

5. In the js folder, create a file and call it `game.js`. You can reference the `game_finished.js` file for the completed game code

6. To create the game, lets create some variables and an initializing function

```javascript
// canvas {Object} our canvas to draw on
// context {Object} graphics that lets us draw
// keys {Keys} controls state of key presses at any time
// localPlayer {Player} our player object
var
  canvas,
  context,
  keys,
  localPlayer;

/**
 * initialize the game
 */
function init() {
  // Set canvas and context
  canvas = document.getElementById('gameCanvas');
  context = canvas.getContext('2d');

  // Create the new Keys object
  keys = new Keys();

  // Make canvas full screen
  canvas.width = window.innerWidth;
  canvas.height = window.innerHeight;

  // Create a player with random starting coordinated
  var
    startX = Math.round(Math.random() * (canvas.width - 5)),
    startY = Math.round(Math.random() * (canvas.height - 5));

  localPlayer = new Player(startX, startY);
}
```

7. This will initialize the players, but not draw anything. Lets create an animate, update, and draw method

```javascript
/**
 * Calls update and draw 60 times a second
 */
function animate() {
  update();
  draw();

  window.requestAnimationFrame(animate);
}

/**
 * updates player based on state of keys pressed
 */
function update() {
  localPlayer.update(keys);
}

/**
 * draw player onto canvas
 */
function draw() {
  // clear canvas every time
  context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

  localPlayer.draw(context);
}
```

8. When you run your `index.html` in the browser, you'll notice that nothing gets drawn! That's because in Javascript, nothing gets called until you call it, so `init` and `animate` are never getting called.

9. Add these two function declarations at the bottom of your `game.js` to see a square appear everytime you refresh the page.

```javascript
// Initialize and animate the game
init();
animate();
```

10. Now let's make our player move, at the end of the `init` function, add a declaration for the `setEventHandlers` function.

```javascript
setEventHandlers();
```

11. Now this doesn't do anything since we haven't created the function yet. Lets create it in `game.js`

```javascript
/**
 * sets event handlers on certain user events (keydown, keyup, and resize)
 */
function setEventHandlers() {
  // Keyboard
  window.addEventListener("keydown", onKeyDown);
  window.addEventListener("keyup", onKeyUp);

  // Window resize
  window.addEventListener("resize", onResize);
}
```

12. What this does is call the `onKeyDown` function when the `keydown` event is fired by the browser, the `onKeyUp` function when `keyup` is fired, and so on. But we haven't yet decided how we want to handle key presses, let's do that. Create the `onKeyDown`, `onKeyUp`, and `onResize` functions.

```javascript
/**
 * track what key was pressed down
 * @param e {Object} key press data
 */
function onKeyDown(e) {
  localPlayer ? keys.onKeyDown(e) : false;
}

/**
 * track what key was let go
 * @param e {Object} key press data
 */
function onKeyUp(e) {
  localPlayer ? keys.onKeyUp(e) : false;
}

/**
 * set canvas to full window width and height
 * when window is resized
 */
function onResize() {
  canvas.width = window.innerWidth;
  canvas.height = window.innerHeight;
}
```

13. Now, when we press a key, we tell our key code to handle the event and it saves the state of key presses.

14. Run your `index.html` file in Chrome and you should now have a little box that moves according to your key presses!
