# Building a Simple File Server

1. Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/

2. A package.json file is used to outline dependencies for a project. In our case, we need express, which makes creating our server much easier. When you run `npm install` in Git Bash, the dependencies are installed.

3. To start our basic server, using Git Bash, run the command

```
  node app.js
```

4. This will run the server file, and you can now navigate to localhost:8080 (in your browser) to see your app.
