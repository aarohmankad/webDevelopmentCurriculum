## Web Development for Intermediate Programmers;

This course is for students in high school or college with at least AP CS experience or some CS101 experience. However, I encourage you to try the course even if you don't meet those suggested requirements!

### Projects

There are a total of ten projects in this course. Each project ranges between 1-3 hour(s) to complete from start to finish. I suggest finishing a project a week, making the course a relatively quick two month affair. That said, feel free to move at your own pace, there is no penalty for taking a little longer to fully grasp a certain concept!

#### Project Order

There is a recommended track for you in this course, consisting of seven of the ten courses. The other three are extra credit if you wish to continue in a game development capacity.

You start off by learning how to save your code online and collaborate with other people (without using Google Docs/Drive) and end with creating your own API and a client to interface with that API. Don't worry if you don't know what some of these words mean yet, you'll learn them quickly :)

Without further ado, here is the recommended course structure:

Project | What you're learning | What you make
------------ | ------------- | -------------
[Learning Git](learning-git/) | Git, Source Control | You will be creating a Github account that will allow you to share your code online and save it so you can work on it anywhere you go.
Using Weather API | HTML, Javascript | This project will be your first introduction to a web project. Stick with it and you'll build your own Weather App!
Using Flickr API | HTML, Javascript | This should feel familiar to the Weather project, but we'll use a different API and I'll hold your hand a little less.
File Server | Node.js, Express | Now that we're familiar with how to create a web app, we're going to work with Node.js, which will let us create our own servers and databases. But for now, we're just going to have it return a file when we ask for it.
Querying Mongoose | Node.js, MongoDB | With this project, we're going to create a model for a Student, and create/read/update/delete instances of that model.
Making an API - Server | Node.js, MongoDB, Express | This is Part 1 of the meaty finale of this course. You will create your own API (like the ones you using in the Weather project and the Flickr project) that will manage a school of students from our previous project.
Making an API - Client | HTML, Javascript | This is Part 2 of the meaty finale of this course. Now that you've created your API, you will create a client web app that can interface with this API. Practically, it is a form like the ones you see when you sign up on websites like Facebook or Google.
