Couldn't get it huh? Or maybe you did and you want to see
if you got it right. Well here's how:

To remove the players, we need to able to get a player based
on a unique attribute (the id). So in server.js, add this function

  /**
   * return player based on unique id
   * @param id {String} unique id for a player object
   * @return {Player}
   */
  function findPlayerById (id) {
    for (var i = 0; i < players.length; i++) {
      if (id === players[i].id) {
        return players[i];
      }
    }

    return null;
  }

We want to remove a player when the player disconnects, or 
closes the browser. To do this, add this code to onClientDisconnect

  var removePlayer = findPlayerById(this.id);

  if (!removePlayer) {
    console.log('Player not found:', this.id);
    return false;
  }

  // This is just a fancy way to remove the player 
  // from the array
  players.splice(players.indexOf(removePlayer), 1);
 
  // Tell all other players that this player left.
  this.broadcast.emit('remove player', {
    id: this.id,
  });

We also want to add the findPlayerById function in our game.js file.
Note that the code is a little different.

  /**
   * return player based on unique id
   * @param id {String} unique id for a player object
   * @return {Player}
   */
  function findPlayerById (id) {
    for (var i = 0; i < remotePlayers.length; i++) {
      if (id === remotePlayers[i].id) {
        return remotePlayers[i];
      }
    }

    return null;
  }

Now when our server sends the "remove player" event, we want to remove 
that player from our game. To do that, add this code to the onRemovePlayer function

  var removePlayer = findPlayerById(data.id);

  if (!removePlayer) {
    console.log('Player not found:', data.id);
    return false;
  }

  // Again, just a fancy way to remove a player
  remotePlayers.splice(remotePlayers.indexOf(removePlayer), 1);

Restart the server (Ctrl+C to close it if it's already running, then `node server.js`)
Open the game in the browser and you should only see one box when you refresh the page.
When you open the file in a different window, you should see two boxes (simulating two players)

Yay you're done with this tutorial!
